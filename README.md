# AugmentedRealityStoryBook-ClickHere
A collection containing an android application install file (containing the AR storybook application), ReadMe file containing information about requirements, and the code used to script the game in Unity.

Greetings from a public library!

This repository contains the fruits of my labors involved with making an augmented reality storybook for a publib library.

This application was built in the Game Development Engine Unity.
It currently works on any android device that runs Android 7.0 or higher and is supported by Google Play Services for AR.

All content was created by myself but some of you may recognize the influence of the childerens author Herve Tullet.
